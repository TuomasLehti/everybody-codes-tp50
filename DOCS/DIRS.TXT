DIRS 1.1.0 - directory functions recursively


Usage


  DIRS <command> [source] [destination]


Commands


  DIR - lists directory entries

  DEL - deletes files

  RD or RMDIR - removes directories

  COPY - recreates directory structure and copies files

  BACKUP - like copy but copies only files which are newer than the ones
           in the destination


Source


  Defines the source directory, which is the starting point for processing
  the files and subdirectories. If no source directory is given, the
  processing starts from the current directory.

  A file name mask with wildcards can also be given. It must be given
  directly after the source directory, no spaces, as if the whole source
  argument is a fully qualified file name.

  If no mask is given, all files will be processed.


Destination


  Defines the destination directory in much the same way as the source
  directory is given. The only exception is that a file name mask is not
  allowed.

  It is important to note that the destination directory must not be a
  subdirectory of the source directory!


Examples


  DIRS DIR

    Lists all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.

  DIRS DIR SRC\*.PAS

    Lists all the Pascal source code in SRC-subdirectory and its subdirs.

  DIRS DIR A:\*.EXE

    Lists all the executables on the disk in the A drive.

# Everybody Codes in TP 5.0

Some solvers for puzzles from Everybody Codes in Turbo Pascal 5.0. Created by 
Tuomas Lehti August 2025.

## About

[Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/) is an ever-growing set of 
programming puzzles, which may be solved in any programming language.

This repo contains the puzzles which I've chosen to solve using 
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) 5.0, which is an 
ancient Pascal IDE from the 1980s. I run TP in an emulated 25 MHz 486 with 
4 MB of memory and [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) 4 as the 
operating system inside [86box](https://86box.net/).

It should be possible to run the programs in more modern environments as well.

The motivation behind it all is to stay in touch with my past. Turbo Pascal was
my next step after BASIC (VIC-20 and GWBASIC in PCs). It's fun to immerse
myself back in that time and see how my programming skills have developed
through the decades. I can now, with modern software and increased knowledge, 
accomplish things I never even dreamed of then, and I want to see if they
would have been possible at the time.

This is just a hobby for me, as is programming in general. This repo may
just cease to develop and evolve without prior warning, if things aren't
fun anymore, or if I don't have the time to delve in the past.

# Coding Puzzles in TP 5.0

Some solvers for coding puzzles in Turbo Pascal 5.0. Created by Tuomas Lehti

## About

[Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes/) and 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) are ever-growing sets of 
programming puzzles, which may be solved in any programming language.

This repo contains the puzzles which I've chosen to solve using 
[Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) 5.0, which is an 
ancient Pascal IDE from the 1980s. I run TP in an emulated 25 MHz 486 with 
4 MB of memory and [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) 4 as the 
operating system inside [86box](https://86box.net/).

It should be possible to run the programs in more modern environments as well.

The motivation behind it all is to stay in touch with my past. Turbo Pascal was
my next step after BASIC (VIC-20 and GWBASIC in PCs). It's fun to immerse
myself back in that time and see how my programming skills have developed
through the decades. I can now, with modern software and increased knowledge, 
accomplish things I never even dreamed of then, and I want to see if they
would have been possible at the time.

This is just a hobby for me, as is programming in general. This repo may
just cease to develop and evolve without prior warning, if things aren't
fun anymore, or if I don't have the time to delve in the past.

Even though the repo is named after Everybody Codes, it now contains code for
Advent of Code as well. I may also add some code from [Internationalization
puzzles](https://i18n-puzzles.com/). Tips for other programming puzzle sites
are always welcome.

## Imaext

Imaext is a silly little disk image extractor to make the interoperability
between the emulator and a modern git interface easier.
